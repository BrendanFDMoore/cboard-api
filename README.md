# Cboard API - REST API for CBoard application

[Cboard](https://shayc.github.io/cboard) is an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) web application, allowing users with speech and language impairments (autism, cerebral palsy) to communicate by symbols and text-to-speech.

The app uses the browser's Speech Synthesis API to generate speech when a symbol is clicked, there are 3400 symbols to choose from when creating a board. Cboard is available in 33 languages (support varies by platform - Android, iOS, Windows).
